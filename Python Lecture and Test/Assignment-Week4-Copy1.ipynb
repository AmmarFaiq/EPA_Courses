    "## Assignment Week 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we are going to write a program that guesses passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two files are provided: \n",
    "  * ```words.txt``` - this file contains a list of English words, one word per line\n",
    "  * ```passwordfile.txt``` - this file contais a list of username:passwordhash combinations, one per line. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The password file\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-known way to authenticate users is through the use of a username and password. If the user can provide the correct password, the user is granted access. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check the password, the system uses a *password file*, in which known username, password (both strings) combinations are stored, one combination per line. However, for security reasons, passwords are not stored in plain-text, but an encrypted version (called a *hash*) of the password string is stored instead. Hashes are computed using the function ```encrypt_password()```, which is provided below. This way, if the password file is stolen, the passwords are not immediately visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if username \"John\" has password \"secret\", then instead of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "John:secret\n",
    "```\n",
    "the following is stored in the password file (see also below):\n",
    "```\n",
    "John:2bb80d537b1da3e38bd30361aa855686bde0eacd7162fef6a25fe97bf527a25b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When John wants to login into the system, then John provides his username and plaintext password. Then the system uses the ```encrypt_password()``` function to compute the hash of the provided password and compares the result to what it finds in the password file for the user John. If both strings match each other, John is granted access, otherwise not. \n"
