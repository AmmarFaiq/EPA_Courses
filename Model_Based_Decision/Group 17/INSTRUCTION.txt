# Instruction !!!!!!!

- Before running the simulation, please install "prim" library. We strongly suggest not to run the experiments since it will take to run the whole code. 
We advise to run the scipts with a file of our results of experiments to save time. To do this, please run all cell below the "perform experiments" that have "read" function inside.

- Since all the script from the section 4 need the code from section 1 to 3 please run section 1 to three to perform the script for 
section 4 onwards.

NOTES:

SINCE WE FORGOT THE SEED, FOR THE SECTION 4 ONWARDS, PLEASE USE THE FILE PROVIDED!!!. TO RUN SECTION 5 ONWARDS, JUST RUN FUNCTION WITH 
"read_csv" to see the same results as the one in the report!
