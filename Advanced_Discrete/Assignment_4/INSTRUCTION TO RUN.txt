Pre-requiste to run the real-time simulation:

- There is "Google Chrome" browser installed
- There are program called "chromedriver.exe" in the ipynb notebook folder to capture html picture (provided for windows)
- _roads_3.csv , BMMS_overview.xlsx, and RMMS folder need to be in ipynb notebook folder

Instruction: 

1. 	There are 2 ipynb file, the "visualization.ipynb" used to visualize the simio simulation every hour in simulation 
	and "Bridge_Controller.ipynb" used to break a bridge while the simulation running.
2.	Visualization part need to be run while the simulation is running with run time of 1000. "The last two cell" of this ipynb 
	need to be in approximately the same time as the the simulation is running. So after user run the simio simulation, user need
	to go directly to the "Visualization.ipynb" to run the "last two cell" of the jupyter notebook. As the simulation running, at
	every 1 hour in the simulation, the python code will visualize the traffic with broken bridge (if it exists) at that particular
	hour. And at the end of the simulation, user can see the recap of visualization for every hour.
3.	On the other hand, the "Bridge_Controller.ipynb" can be run anytime the simulation run, with simio updating the bridge broken 
	info from the database every hour of simulation. NOTES : The name need to be exactly the same as the one in simulation, therefore
	"Simulation_all_bridges.html" is provided to navigate through which part of the bridge names belong to certain location.
